		<article class="abstract">
			<p>
				In this visualisation I look at the number of undertrials and convicts in prisons from every state across India and attempt to see if this ration holds constant across India. While is most places I see a clear continuous trend in the raito, there are instances even in large states like Haryana or UP, that the ratio changes significantly. We can only guess as to why this sudden change might have occured or credit/blame the judiciary for the decreasing/increasing ratio. My hypothesis is that a huge increase in number of arrests can be associated with elections in a state.

				Here is the first visualisation from 2009
			</h4>
			<p>
				In the year 2009, which in this series of visualisations is the first visualisation we can observe the ratios across the country. There are stark abnormalities like Arunachal pradesh with undertrials around thirty times more than the convicts! But this is only because the number convicts is only two. Kashmir also shows about five times undertrials and this can be attributed to the insurgencies and the protests. This number is significant as it is election year in Kashmir and we will get the same numbers again during elections in 2014. Bihar also has a large ratio and this can be attributed the anti crime campaign of the Nitish Kumar lead JDU govt. Himachal Pradesh is the only state where the number of convicts is larger than the number of undertrials and will remain so in this series of visualisations.<br>

				Here is a visualisation from year 2012
			</h4>
			<p>
				The same pattern continues in this visualisation, with some changes here and there. Almost all changes are minor and the ratio has not changed much over three years. States like Goa and to certain extent Punjab experienced a higher ratio because of the general elections held there in 2012.<br>

				Now, we look at 2014!
			</h4>
			<p>
				Four years changed a lot in many Indian prisons. While the ratio is constant in states like Kashmir (where it has come down to 2009 levels), there is a considerable increase in the ratio in states like Rajasthan, Odisha, Jharkhand, Haryana and Tamil Nadu. It can be observed that elections happened in these states between 2012 and 2014. The number of arrests has come down in Kashmir again with an eye on the elections. In most other states arrests are seen as a good move by the police, while it seems in Kashmir it not quite the case.<br>
